# To-Do List

A simple To-Do List app built in Vanilla JS. The todos will be accessible even after the browser is closed thanks to localStorage.

The "Home" tab provides an interface to create quick tasks, while more complex interconnected tasks can be organized in projects, which will show up in the "Today" tab on the day they're due.
